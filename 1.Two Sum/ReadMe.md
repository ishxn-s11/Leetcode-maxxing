Problem Statement:-
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: cardPoints = [1,2,3,4,5,6,1], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: After the first step, your score will always be 1. However, choosing the rightmost card first will maximize your total score. 
The optimal strategy is to take the three cards on the right, giving a final score of 1 + 6 + 5 = 12.

Example 2:
Input: cardPoints = [2,2,2], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Regardless of which two cards you take, your score will always be 4.

Example 3:
Input: cardPoints = [9,7,7,9,7,7,9], k = 7
Output: 55
Explanation: You have to take all the cards. Your score is the sum of points of all cards.

Constraints:-
1 <= cardPoints.length <= 105
1 <= cardPoints[i] <= 104
1 <= k <= cardPoints.length
